# my-starter-kit

**my-starter-kit** is my personal code library built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It serves as a lightweight plug-and-play toolkit that I can reuse across different projects.  

The goal is to have ready-made, reusable components such as:
- Sidebar menus  
- Popup messages  
- Common UI widgets  

This project helps me speed up development by keeping a simple and consistent foundation I can adapt anywhere.
