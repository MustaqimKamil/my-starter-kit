# my-starter-kit

**my-starter-kit** is my personal code library built with plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It serves as a lightweight plug-and-play toolkit that I can reuse across different projects.  

The goal is to have ready-made, reusable components such as:
- Sidebar menus  
- Popup messages  
- Common UI widgets

## Contributing

Since this is my personal starter kit, the main branch is **read-only** for others.  
If you’d like to suggest changes or improvements:  

1. **Fork** this repository  
2. Make your changes in your own fork  
3. Submit a **Pull Request (PR)**  

I’ll review contributions and merge if they align with the project’s goals.

The main idea is to keep things simple, reusable, and easy to adapt for any project.
